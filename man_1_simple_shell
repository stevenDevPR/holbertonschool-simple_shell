2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd holbertonschool-simple_shell`
3. Compile the source code: `gcc -o shell simple-shell.c`
4. Run the command interpreter: `./shell`

.SH OPERATION
The initial version of the shell, Simple Shell, provides basic functionality as follows:
- Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. The command line always ends with a new line.
- The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
- The command lines are simple, consisting of only one word. No arguments are passed to programs.
- If an executable cannot be found, an error message is printed, and the prompt is displayed again.
- Handles errors and the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D).
- Building upon Simple Shell 0.1, Simple Shell 0.2 introduces the ability to handle command lines with arguments.
- In Simple Shell 0.3, the following enhancements are made:
- Handles the PATH to locate executables.
- Ensures that fork is not called if the command doesnâ€™t exist.
- Implements the exit built-in, allowing the user to exit the shell.
Simple Shell 0.4 adds the implementation of the env built-in, which prints the current environment.
